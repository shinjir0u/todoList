# ToDoList

    This project is to develop a todo list web application while utilizing OOP and SOLID concepts.

## Self Complaint

    This project is the hardest and most time consuming so far.
    Adding new features takes completely different and new logic.
    I learn more about code style and eslint along the way and refactoring takes a long time and energy.
